        The buddy list is the list of cooperating web sites that you exchange
checksum data with. The array index is also referred to as the "Nickname" and
the contents of the element should be the **HTTPS** URL of the cooperating
site's domain name. It will also work with .onion addresses, but I still
highly reccomnend you use HTTPS.
